# exploys

   Explorys is a commercial cloud-based database that aggregates data from electronic health records of participating hospital systems. Currently, it contains more than 50 million patient records. All these data are de-identified and map to proper medical terms. For example, diagnosis is standardized into SNOMED-CT. Prescription and lab test are mapped to RxNORM and LOINC. Large clinic data in Exploys provides us with an opportunity to study disease associations.
    
   This package is to facilitate analysis of Exploys data, ranging from file handling, cohort selection, goodness and contigency tests for two catagery.
